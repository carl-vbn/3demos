    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>
        Welcome to 3Demos. This is a tool dedicated to visualizations for
        multivariable calculus. There are three ways in which one can interact
        with this tool: story mode, creative mode, and session mode.
    </p>

    <p>
        In story mode, the user can select a topic from the table of contents
        menu. A mix of theories, examples, and exercises on the topic will be
        presented along with relevant graphical objects. Some interactive
        elements that can be played on the platform are embedded in the text.
    </p>

    <p>
        Session mode enables users to create a room where they act as the
        host, allowing other users to join as participants. In this mode, the
        host can share objects with other users, pose poll questions, and
        display the poll results to everyone in the room.
    </p>

    <p>
        Creative mode explains how you can create objects and use the tool. To
        start creating simply go to the “Objects” list accessible from the
        lower accordion-style tab. Here, one can create, edit, and remove as
        many of the objects as one pleases. Note that hardware limitations may
        affect performance.

        Drew Youngren, a Lecturer in the Discipline of Applied Mathematics
        within the Department of Applied Physics and Applied Mathematics at
        Columbia University, serves as the Principal Investigator for this
        project. He developed the beta version of the tool as a means to
        engage with his students virtually during the pandemic.

        Special appreciation is extended to
        <a href="https://ctl.columbia.edu">Columbia University's Center for
        Teaching and Learning</a>, which made significant contributions to
        enhancing the tool's performance and accessibility. Additionally, they
        introduced new features such as the robust session mode, greatly
        enriching the learning experience for both students and teachers.

        Finally, the pioneering work of Paul Seeburger and his
        <a href="https://c3d.libretexts.org/CalcPlot3D/index.html">CalcPlot3D</a>
        project deserves acknowledgment, as it covers much of the 
        functionality of this tool, accomplishing it first with better
        performance.
